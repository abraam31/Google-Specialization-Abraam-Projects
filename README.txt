This repo is for all the hands-on projects in Coursera specialization for both Google IT automation and Michigan Python for everybody.
Each folder has its own README to describe the project, and the script python file.


The projects in the specialization were mostly small tedious tasks to deliver the concept, and big projects at the end of the course.

Hence, the big projects will be in separate directories; else all rest small tasks will be included in subdirectories in 'tasks' directory
